BROWSER INVADERS
=====================

Concept vintage game using Brython - Python on Browser project
===============================================================

This is a complete game, if limited, using 
html5's Canvas with Python script, which is translated 
into javascript in runtime, on the client browser.

How to Run 
============

Unpack the game files, and
in the same directory, download Brython 3.0.2 or later from
https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/releases, unpack it,
and rename the Brython directory (in the form of Brython<version>-<date>
for example Brython3.0.2-20150102-140610) as simply "brython".
Then start a web server so that a browser can fetch the files
in the local computer. 

You can use "traditional" C python for this,
typing: "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" at the terminal. 
Afterwards. point your browser to http://localhost:8000, and enjoy
